      <description>The goal of the project is to use the methods we have learned in class and extend our knowledge in smaller groups. Below is an example of a project description. If your group has an alternative proposal, please schedule time to discuss with me prior to the proposal due date.
One example project is to compete in a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). The “Knowledge” competitions are great choices, and we will discuss your choice of competition before you commit.</description>

      <description>Course Objectives Statistical Learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets. The area combines knowledge from statistics and computer science to tackle these “big data” problems and has become a popular area of work. By end of course, students will be able to formulate prediction problems as statistical machine learning problems, choose and apply the appropriate learning methods to their data, conduct well thought-out statistical machine learning experiments and interpret the results, and write technical reports describing their work.</description>
